# TelDirectory - Corporate Phone Directory

TelDirectory is a Next.js web application designed to manage and display a corporate phone directory. It reads directory data from XML files, allowing users to navigate through zones, branches (for specific zones like "Zona Metropolitana"), and localities to find phone extensions. The application also provides an interface to import and manage these XML files, and a search feature to quickly find departments (localities) or extensions. Administrative features like XML import, data modification, and settings are protected by a simple username/password authentication system backed by an SQLite database.

## Core Features:

*   **Hierarchical Directory**: Navigate through Zones, Branches (where applicable), and Localities.
*   **Extension Listing**: View department/contact names and their phone extensions. Extension numbers are clickable (`tel:` links) to initiate calls via system-configured telephony apps.
*   **XML-Based Data**: Directory data is stored in XML files, following Cisco IP Phone standards.
*   **Web Interface**: Browse the directory through a user-friendly web interface.
*   **Global Search**: A search bar on the homepage allows users to quickly find departments (localities) by name, or specific extensions by their name/role or number, across the entire directory.
*   **Authentication**:
    *   A login page (`/login`) protects administrative functionalities.
    *   Default administrator credentials: `admin` / `admin123` (this password should be changed in a real environment, though currently requires direct database update or implementing a password change feature).
    *   User data is stored in an SQLite database (`teldirectory.db`).
*   **Data Management (Authenticated Users Only)**:
    *   Import extensions via CSV file.
    *   Synchronize extension names from one or more external XML feeds (e.g., from FreePBX PHP scripts).
    *   Add, edit, and delete zones, branches, localities, and extensions directly through the web UI.
*   **Customization**:
    *   Dark Mode support (toggle in header and Settings).
    *   Language toggle (English/Espa√±ol - toggle in header and Settings).
    *   Configurable root path for the directory data via the Settings page. The application expects `MainMenu.xml` file to be PascalCase and structural directory names like `zonebranch`, `branch`, `department` to be in **lowercase** within this root path.
    *   Configurable Host and Port for URLs within XML files (via Settings page), ensuring IP phones are directed to the correct application instance.

## Project Structure

*   `src/app/`: Contains the Next.js App Router pages.
    *   `src/app/[zoneId]/...`: Dynamic routes for displaying zone, branch, and locality pages.
    *   `src/app/import-xml/`: Page for settings, CSV import, XML feed sync, and application configuration (protected).
    *   `src/app/login/`: Login page.
*   `src/components/`: Reusable React components.
*   `src/lib/`: Core logic, data fetching utilities (`data.ts`), server actions (`actions.ts`), configuration management (`config.ts`), authentication (`auth-actions.ts`), and database (`db.ts`).
*   `src/context/`: React context for language management.
*   `src/hooks/`: Custom React hooks.
*   `src/locales/`: JSON files for internationalization (i18n).
*   `src/middleware.ts`: Handles route protection for authenticated areas.
*   `ivoxsdir/` (Default location, configurable via Settings): **Crucial directory** for storing all XML data.
    *   `ivoxsdir/MainMenu.xml`: The root XML file for the directory structure (ensure this filename is PascalCase: `MainMenu.xml`).
    *   `ivoxsdir/zonebranch/`: Contains XML files for each zone (e.g., `ZonaEste.xml`, `ZonaMetropolitana.xml`) (ensure this directory name is lowercase: `zonebranch`).
    *   `ivoxsdir/branch/`: Contains XML files for branches, primarily used by Zona Metropolitana (e.g., `AdmCorporativo.xml`) (ensure this directory name is lowercase: `branch`).
    *   `ivoxsdir/department/`: Contains XML files for each locality/department, listing extensions (e.g., `Bavaro.xml`) (ensure this directory name is lowercase: `department`).
*   `.config/directory.config.json`: Stores the custom path to the `ivoxsdir` data if specified in Settings.
*   `teldirectory.db`: SQLite database file created in the project root (should be added to `.gitignore`). Stores user credentials.
*   `public/`: Static assets.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (v18.x or later recommended)
*   npm or yarn

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-name>
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```
This will install Next.js, React, ShadCN components, Tailwind, SQLite, bcrypt, and other necessary packages.

### 3. `ivoxsdir` Directory Setup

The application relies on XML files for its directory data. By default, it looks for a directory named `ivoxsdir` (all lowercase) at the root of your project. You can change this path via the application's Settings page (after logging in).

*   **Create the `ivoxsdir` directory** (or your custom named directory) at the root of your project or at your chosen custom location.
*   Inside `ivoxsdir`, create the following subdirectories **using lowercase names**:
    *   `zonebranch`
    *   `branch`
    *   `department`
*   **Populate with XML files**:
    *   Place your `MainMenu.xml` file (ensure filename is PascalCase: `MainMenu.xml`) in the `ivoxsdir` directory.
    *   Place your zone-specific XML files (e.g., `ZonaEste.xml`, `ZonaMetropolitana.xml`) in `ivoxsdir/zonebranch/`.
    *   Place your branch-specific XML files (e.g., for Zona Metropolitana's sub-menus like `AdmCendis.xml`) in `ivoxsdir/branch/`.
    *   Place your department/locality XML files (listing extensions) in `ivoxsdir/department/`.

    *The application includes sample XML files in the `IVOXS` directory in the initial project structure. You should rename this to `ivoxsdir` (or your custom name), ensure the structural subdirectories (`zonebranch`, `branch`, `department`) are lowercase and `MainMenu.xml` is PascalCase, and replace these with your actual directory data.*

### 4. Database Setup (SQLite)

*   The application uses an SQLite database (`teldirectory.db`) to store user credentials.
*   This file will be **automatically created in your project root** the first time you run the application.
*   An initial administrator user will be seeded with credentials:
    *   Username: `admin`
    *   Password: `admin123`
    **It is strongly recommended to change this password in a real environment.** (Currently, changing the password requires direct database modification or implementing a password change feature.)
*   **Add `teldirectory.db` to `.gitignore`**:
    ```
    # .gitignore
    teldirectory.db
    teldirectory.db-journal
    *.db-shm
    *.db-wal
    ```

## Running the Application

### Development Environment (Prueba)

1.  **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The application will typically start on `http://localhost:3000` (port configured in `package.json`).

2.  **Accessing the App:**
    *   Web UI: Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.
    *   Login: Navigate to `/login` or attempt to access the Settings page (`/import-xml`) to be redirected. Use the default credentials (`admin`/`admin123`) or any other users you add to the database.
    *   Access administrative features via the Settings page or through UI elements that appear after login.

3.  **Data Management:**
    *   The application reads XML files from the configured `ivoxsdir` path.
    *   Any changes made via the UI (adding/editing/deleting items, importing CSVs, syncing from feeds) will directly modify these XML files, provided the application has write permissions to the `ivoxsdir` directory and its contents.

### Production Environment (Productivo)

Deploying a Next.js application to run unattended in production typically involves a process manager like PM2.

1.  **Build the Application:**
    On your production server, navigate to the project directory and run:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
    This command creates an optimized production build in the `.next` directory.

2.  **Install PM2 Globally (if not already installed):**
    ```bash
    sudo npm install pm2 -g
    ```

3.  **Start the Application with PM2:**
    From your project directory, run:
    ```bash
    pm2 start npm --name "teldirectory" -- run start
    ```
    *   `pm2 start npm`: Tells PM2 to run an npm script.
    *   `--name "teldirectory"`: Assigns a manageable name to your process.
    *   `-- run start`: Executes the `start` script from your `package.json` (which is `next start -p 3000`).

4.  **PM2 Management Commands:**
    *   `pm2 list`: View running processes.
    *   `pm2 logs teldirectory`: View logs for your application.
    *   `pm2 stop teldirectory`: Stop the application.
    *   `pm2 restart teldirectory`: Restart the application.
    *   `pm2 delete teldirectory`: Remove the application from PM2.

5.  **(Recommended) Setup PM2 Startup Script:**
    To ensure your application restarts automatically if the server reboots:
    ```bash
    pm2 startup
    ```
    Follow the instructions PM2 provides (usually a command to run with `sudo`). Then, save your current PM2 process list:
    ```bash
    pm2 save
    ```

6.  **Production Environment Considerations:**
    *   **`teldirectory.db` Database File**:
        *   Ensure the `teldirectory.db` file is present in the project root (or the location where the application expects it based on `process.cwd()` when run by PM2).
        *   The user account running the PM2 process (and thus the Next.js application) **must have read and write permissions** to this database file and its directory.
    *   **`ivoxsdir` Directory**:
        *   The `ivoxsdir` directory (with all its XML files and correct casing for subfolders: `zonebranch`, `branch`, `department` as lowercase, and `MainMenu.xml` as PascalCase) **must be present at the location specified in the application's settings** (or at the project root if using the default).
        *   The user running the PM2 process **must have read and write permissions** to this directory and its contents if you intend to use the UI for modifications (XML imports, sync, manual edits, CSV imports).
    *   **`.config/directory.config.json`**: If you use a custom path for `ivoxsdir`, this file must be present in the project's `.config/` directory and be readable by the application process.
    *   **Environment Variables**: For critical settings (e.g., a future, more secure admin password method), use environment variables. PM2 can manage these.
    *   **Firewall**: Make sure your server's firewall allows incoming TCP connections on the port the application is running on (e.g., port `3000`).
        *   Example for `ufw` (Ubuntu): `sudo ufw allow 3000/tcp`

7.  **Accessing in Production:**
    *   Web UI: `http://YOUR_SERVER_IP_OR_DOMAIN:3000`

## Using the Import Feature (Authenticated Users)

The "Settings" page (`/import-xml`), accessible after logging in, allows users to:

*   **Configure `ivoxsdir` Path**: Set the absolute path to the root directory containing your XML data.
*   **Configure Network Settings for XML URLs**: Define the Host and Port that will be written into the URLs within `MainMenu.xml`, `zonebranch/*.xml`, and `branch/*.xml` files. This is crucial if your XMLs are used by IP phones.
*   **Import Extensions from CSV**: Upload a CSV file (columns: `Name,Extension,LocalityID,ZoneID`) to bulk add extensions. New department XMLs and parent menu links will be created if necessary.
*   **Synchronize Names from XML Feed**: Provide one or more URLs to external XML feeds (e.g., from PHP scripts connected to FreePBX). The application will update extension names in your local department XMLs based on these feeds and report conflicts or missing extensions.

**Caution**: Actions like CSV import, XML feed sync, and applying network settings directly modify your XML files in the `ivoxsdir`. Ensure you have backups if needed.

## Search Functionality

*   **Global Search (Homepage)**: The homepage features a prominent search bar. Users can type to search for:
    *   Department/Locality names.
    *   Extension names/roles (e.g., "Sales CAJ1", "John Doe").
    *   Extension numbers.
    Search results will display matching localities, highlighting the part that matched (locality name or specific extension details), and provide a direct link to the locality's page.

*   **Zone-Specific Search**: Each zone page features a search bar that allows users to quickly find localities or branches (if applicable, like in Zona Metropolitana) within that specific zone by name or ID.

## XML Structure

The application reads and writes XML data structured for Cisco IP Phones:

*   **Menu Structure (`CiscoIPPhoneMenu`)**: Used for `MainMenu.xml`, `zonebranch/*.xml`, and `branch/*.xml`. Contains `<MenuItem>` elements with `<Name>` and `<URL>`.
*   **Directory Structure (`CiscoIPPhoneDirectory`)**: Used for `department/*.xml`. Contains `<DirectoryEntry>` elements with `<Name>` (department/contact) and `<Telephone>` (extension).

Refer to Cisco IP Phone documentation for detailed XML specifications if needed.
